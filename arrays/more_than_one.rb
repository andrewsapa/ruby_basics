#In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

#Select 'fish' and 'lizard' from pets at the same time, assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the value of my_pets.




pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pets = "I have a pet #{pets[2]} and a pet #{pets[3]}!"

puts my_pets
