# In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless 
#break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value 
#break sets the return value to for the while loop.

#A break statement is used to forcefully leave a block of code early. Break 
#accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is “breaking” out of and returns nil.
